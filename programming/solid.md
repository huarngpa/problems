# SOLID

In-depth explanation [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/solid-principle-in-programming-understand-with-real-life-examples/)

## Single Responsibility

- Every class should have a single responsibility or purpose

## Open / Closed

- Open for extension, but closed for modification

## Liskov's Substitution

- Derived (child) classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes
  - You can use the child class in it's parent's place without any unexpected behavior

## Interface Segregation

- Do not force any client to an interface irrelevant to them

## Dependency Inversion

- High-level modules or classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend upon abstractions
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon abstractions
