# Principles

Customer Obsession

- Leaders start with the customer and work backwards.
- They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust.
- Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

Ownership

- Leaders are owners.
- They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results.
- They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond their own team.
- They never say that's not my job.

Invent and Simplify

- Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify.
- They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here".
- As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
