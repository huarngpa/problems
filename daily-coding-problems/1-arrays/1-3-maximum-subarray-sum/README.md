# Calculate maximum subarray sum

Find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the array. For example, given `[34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86]` the maximum sum would be 137 since `[42, 14, -5, 86]` and given the array `[-5, -1, -8, -9]` the maximum sum would be 0 since we would choose not to take any elements.
