# ACID

## Atomicity

- All changes to data are performed as a single operation (all or none)

## Consistency

- Data is in a consistent state when a transaction start and ends

## Isolation

- Intermediate state of a transaction is invisible to other transactions
- Transactions that run concurrently appear to be serialized

## Durability

- Data is persisted into a durable medium
