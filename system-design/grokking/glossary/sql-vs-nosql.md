# SQL vs NoSQL

## Storage

SQL stores in tables.

NoSQL optimizes for:

- Key-value
- Document
- Graph
- Columnar

## Schema

SQL ensures records conform to a fixed schema.

NoSQL schemas are dynamic, ie. columns are properties can be added on the fly.

## Querying

SQL has the structured query language which is incredibly powerful.

NoSQL has UnQL (unstructured query language) which is system specific.

## Scalability

SQL databases are usually vertically scalable.

NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

## Reliability or ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable)

SQL focuses on ACID.

NoSQL solutions will sacrifice some elements of ACID.

## Reasoning

Use SQL when you need reliability (ie. ACID).

Use NoSQL when you don't want data to be your bottleneck.
